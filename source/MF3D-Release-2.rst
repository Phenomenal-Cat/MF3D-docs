  ^^^^^^
  Despite numerous requets for this planned development of the MF3D avatar, the project is currently suspended due to a lack of technical expertise or the right people to outsource it to. If you think you or somebody you know can help with the :ref:`expression transfer <methods_expressiontransfer>` process needed to adapt the model then get in touch. 



What's in MF3D R2?
------------------

A major limitation of the method used to produce the first stimulus set :link-badge:`MF3D-Release-1, MF3D R1, ref,badge-primary text-white` was that facial expression and facial identity could not be co-varied simultaneously. Consequently, MF3D R1 contained an :ref:`expression subset <mf3d-r1-expression>` in which facial identity was held constant (identity M02) and a separate :ref:`identity subset <mf3d-r1-identity>` in which expression was held constant (neutral expression). Using a computational operation known as 'expression cloning' (or more generally 'shape deformation transfer'), we are now able to transfer facial expressions across identities to generate a novel stimulus set of CGI
macaque faces with unparalleled parametric control.

MF3D R2 Subsets
----------------------------

.. tab-set::
  :class: sd-bg-light sd-rounded-2 p-2

  .. tab-item:: Expression x Identity

    The static stimuli of MF3D R2 will extend those of R1 by covarying the following variables:

    -  expression types

    -  expression intensities

    -  head orientations

    -  identity dimensions

    -  identity distinctiveness levels

    -  lighting directions


  .. tab-item:: Animation subset

    The animated component of the MF3D R2 stimulus set will replicate the :link-badge:`mf3d-r1-animation, animation subset, ref, badge-success text-white` of MF3D R1, but includes a variety of facial identities of the avatar.
