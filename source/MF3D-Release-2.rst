What's in MF3D R2?
------------------

A major limitation of the method used to produce the first stimulus set :link-badge:`MF3D-Release-1, MF3D R1, ref,badge-primary text-white` was that facial expression and facial identity could not be co-varied simultaneously. Consequently, MF3D R1 contained an :ref:`expression subset <mf3d-r1-expression>` in which facial identity was held constant (identity M02) and a separate :ref:`identity subset <mf3d-r1-identity>` in which expression was held constant (neutral expression). Using a computational operation known as 'expression cloning' (or more generally 'shape deformation transfer'), we are now able to transfer facial expressions across identities to generate a novel stimulus set of CGI
macaque faces with unparalleled parametric control.

MF3D R2 Subsets
----------------------------

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Expression x Identity

    .. note::
      The static stimuli of MF3D R2 will extend those of release 1 by
      covarying the following variables:

      -  expression types

      -  expression intensities

      -  head orientations

      -  identity dimensions

      -  identity distinctiveness levels

      -  lighting directions


  .. tab:: Animation subset

    The animated component of the MF3D R2 stimulus set replicates the :link-badge:`mf3d-r1-animation, animation subset, ref, badge-success text-white` of MF3D R1, but includes a variety of facial identities of the avatar.
