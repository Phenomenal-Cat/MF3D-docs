  Blender (.blend) files of the MF3D avatar are currently available upon request, however the learning curve is still quite steep for those unfamiliar with CGI software. We are working on cleaning and simplifyting the files, and to produce a guide that will allow researchers to more easily generate and render their own custom stimuli using this resource. Updates will be made available here.


The MF3D avatar(s) were creating using a variety analysis and modelling software (as described in `Murphy & Leopold, 2019 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2019.06.001>`_) before being assembled in the open-source 3D software `Blender <https://www.blender.org>`_. This powerful software is free to download, has a large online user community and an experienced development team with an excellent track record.
